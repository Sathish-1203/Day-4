Paths and Link Behavior
Target attribute types: Controlling link behavior.
Absolute vs. relative paths: Navigating directories.
Path syntax: Understanding /, ./, ../ for file navigation.
Link states: Managing different link interactions (hover, active).
Internal links: Linking to another section of the page by using href="#id" on an a element and giving the destination element the same id.
Importance of Semantic HTML
Structural hierarchy for heading elements: It is important to use the correct heading element to maintain the structural hierarchy of the content. The h1 element is the highest level of heading and the h6 element is the lowest level of heading.
Presentational HTML elements: Elements that define the appearance of content, e.g., the deprecated center, big, and font elements.
Semantic HTML elements: These elements provide meaning to the structure of the content. Examples include:
<header>: Represents introductory content.
<nav>: Contains navigation links.
<article>: Represents self-contained content.
<aside>: Used for sidebars or related content.
<section>: Groups related content within a document.
<footer>: Defines the footer for a section or document.
